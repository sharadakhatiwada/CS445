    <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <p>• Since we were undoing the very last commit we made, we were able to use HEAD as
    the argument to revert. We can revert any arbitrary commit earlier in history by
    simply specifying its hash value.</p>
    <pre>The revert command of the previous section is a powerful command that lets us
    undo the effects of any commit in the repository. However, both the original commit
    and the “undoing” commit are visible in the branch history (using the git log
    command).</pre>
